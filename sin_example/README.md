This is an example of Gaussian Process modeled on sinusoid data plus noise. The posterior predictive distribution was sampled from MCMC simulations (using PyMC3).

The plots include:

- Predictive mean and 2 sigma region

- Posterior predictive over function (noisy and noise-free, each with 20 samples plotted)
